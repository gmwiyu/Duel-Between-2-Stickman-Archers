# Duel-Between-2-Stickman-Archers
There are two modes in the game, namely the ARCRDE MODE and WAVES MODE. In the ARCRDE MODE, the player is the stickman shooter standing in the lower left corner, and she/he is expected to shoot the enemy before the opponent shoots him/her. Hold and drag your bow and arrow after aiming at the right object to destroy the enemy and get scores and gold! When the gold gets enough, your character will have a new upgrade; while in the WAVES MODE, the only thing that the player have to do is to shoot the props and targets.
